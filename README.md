feel free to use these as a template (or rip things off as you need) for your own site, even though I can't force it, but leaving a note to credit me by keeping my name on the homepage and in the repository readme is much appreciated and ohh, ensure to fill out the necessary `.env` variables outlined in the `app/env.ts` file.
